The \"DR\" monogram serves as a strong visual anchor while maintaining the typographic focus of the project. It was also inspired by my grandmother who always engraved her pottery with a similar monogram of her initials. However, her monogram used purely straight lines. Due to the requirements of the project I could not copy that exactly.Looking back, I could have explored more dramatic size contrasts between typographic elements to create even stronger visual hierarchy. While the current design is clean and functional, there's room for more typographic experimentation that could have pushed the boundaries of the assignment further. Rather than adapt my idea for the monogram to fit within the requirements, I should've created my own distinct concept had be an alternative business card option alongside this one." ]

					{
						"name": "What I Did Right",
						"content": [ "The symbolic elements in both designs effectively communicate the themes of the play without relying on literal interpretations. The first poster successfully integrates the performance information as part of the design rather than treating it as secondary content. The stark contrast between the white typography and red background creates immediate visual impact, making the posters attention-grabbing even from a distance. The minimalist approach allows the symbolic elements (feather, thorny branches) to carry significant conceptual weight. I also effectively used feedback from classmates for this project." ]

						"name": "What I Learned",
						"content": [ "Creating a series of designs requires careful attention to color consistency and information hierarchy to maintain visual cohesion. Even with different conceptual approaches, core design elements should follow similar rules to create a unified collection.

Finding the balance between artistic expression and functional communication is essential for effective promotional materials." ]

The typography-based cover was good at showing the claustrophobic feeling of constant surveillance by using densely packed relevant words and concepts. The handmade cover successfully translated the Party's omnipresent eye symbol into a tangible, textured design. My designer's choice cover achieved visual impact through minimalism, combining the camera and eye to reinforce the theme of surveillance." ]
