## Project Structure

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Use `npm run start` for local development

## Deployment

The site is deployed using GitHub Pages. The deployment process is automated through GitHub Actions, utilizing
angular-cli-ghpages.

**Note on angular-cli-ghpages:** As of the current development phase, angular-cli-ghpages has a known critical security
vulnerability. However, a pull request addressing this issue has been submitted and is expected to be merged before this
website is publicly shared. I am actively monitoring the situation and considering alternative deployment methods if a
fix is not implemented by the time of project completion.
